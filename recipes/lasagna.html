      <h2>Directions for making this beauty</h2>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned.</p> 
          <p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, </p>
          <p>Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</p></li>
      
      <li><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water</p></li>      
          <p>for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine</p>  
          <p> ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p>
      
      <li><p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p></li>    
      
      <li><p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p>
          <p>Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture.</p>
          <p>Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</p>
          <p>epeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</p>
          <p>Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
